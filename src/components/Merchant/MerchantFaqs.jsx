              How can I edit or delete a coupon?

            <Accordion.Body>
              Go to the "Manage Coupons" page and look for the list of your

              How do I check the status of my coupons?
            </Accordion.Header>
            <Accordion.Body>
              Once a coupon is created, you can monitor its redemption status
              (e.g., how many have been used) on the "Manage Coupons" dashboard.
              It will display the number of redeemed coupons and their expiry
              dates.

              What if I need to change the discount value?
            </Accordion.Header>
            <Accordion.Body>
              You can edit the discount value by going to "Manage Coupons",
              selecting the coupon you wish to edit, and updating its discount
              field. Make sure to save your changes.

              Where can I see analytics or usage data?

            <Accordion.Body>
              We provide basic coupon usage analytics under "Reports" or "Manage
              Coupons" (depending on your plan). Youâ€™ll see how many customers
              redeemed each coupon, along with other insights.

# Introduction
This repository is used for the code development process as part of the NUSteals IS3106  project endeavour

# Setup Process
- `node_modules` is included in gitignore so if u clone u need to do `npm install` so that the dependencies in `package.json` will be added
- run the command `npm run dev` to get the development to run in localhost

# Separate Branches
* Might be good to consider separate branches for each stakeholder before pushing changes to main branch
